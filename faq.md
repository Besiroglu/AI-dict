### Who can use the Technical AI Forecasting Dictionary?

The Dictionary is distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/parallel-forecast/AI-dict/blob/master/LICENSE.md),
which means that it's freely available to use by any project.

### Are you trying to establish a consensus interpretation of terms among AI researchers?

No, for two reasons. First, we are simply trying to provide *a* standard of interpretation
to serve a very particular purpose (forecasting). What matters here is not what the
"one true definition" is, but rather whether our definition captures *at least some*
natural category of things.

Second, the Dictionary is targeted at researchers and practitioners of forecasting,
and this set is not co-extensive with the set of AI researchers, even though
there is overlap.

Nonetheless, the Dictionary is [open-source](https://github.com/parallel-forecast/AI-dict/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
and if others find it helpful we welcome their usage.

### Who created the Dictionary and why?

The Dictionary was created by Jacob Lagerros and Ben Goldhaber (Parallel, LLC) in collaboration
with users of forecasting platform Metaculus AI, funded by the [Berkeley Existential
Risk Initiative](http://existence.org/grants/).

It is a piece of infrastructure for the public good. We created it because we
care about society getting the transition to AI right, and because we think
forecasting can help with that.
